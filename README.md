Lab 3: Laser Cutting and 3d Printing

3D Printing
In this lab, we experimented with designing and printing a button. On my first attempt, I created a rather detailed button (Boom_Button.stl). I soon realized, however, that the printer could not accurately reflect the level of detail I was looking for. I therefore created a simpler button (S_Button.stl), which printed much more cleanly.

Laser Cutting 
For the second half of the lab, we experimented with Laser Cutting. I struggled to find an accurate link to download the Inkscape program and therefore downloaded Illustrator instead. I added vector files I found online to the stand cut-out: a pattern, a crown and the letter “S” ( for Sarah :). I then edited the line widths, fillings and color matching to apply cutting and etching. Finally, I set the printing preferences. The first time I set my etching power too high and the pattern was not well maintained on the cardboard. I therefore set the speed higher and the power lower for the “Raster” preferences on my second, successful attempt. I also moved down the model because lines at the top were not carved out.
